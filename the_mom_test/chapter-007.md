Choosing your customers

## Chapter 7

Choosing your customers

They say that startups don’t starve, they drown. You never have too few options, too few leads, or too few ideas; you have too many. You get overwhelmed. You do a little bit of everything. When it comes to getting above water and making faster progress, good customer segmentation is your best friend.

Segmentation

When we look at the big successes, they seem to serve the whole world. Google lets anyone find anything. Paypal helps anyone send money anywhere. Evernote backs up all the writing of everybody.

But they didn’t start there. If you start too generic, everything is watered down. Your marketing message is generic. You suffer feature creep. In their early days, Google helped PhD students find obscure bits of code. Paypal helped collectors buy and sell Pez dispensers and Beanie Babies more efficiently. Evernote helped moms save and share recipes.

When you have a fuzzy sense of who you’re serving, you end up talking to a multiple customer segments all at once, which leads to confusing signals and three problems:

You get overwhelmed by options and don’t know where to start

You aren’t moving forward but can’t prove yourself wrong

You receive mixed feedback and can’t make sense of it

Babies or body builders?

I talked to a woman who had developed a very cool powdered condiment. It was sweet (like a cinnamon brown sugar), but had all the nutrition of a multivitamin. In fact, it was an all-natural superfood: you survive indefinitely eating nothing but that powder.

She said it had countless uses: you could sprinkle it on your breakfast or mix it in with your protein shake. Moms could trick their kids into being healthy. Restaurants could leave it on the tables as a healthy sugar alternative. However, she was running in circles because the bodybuilders wanted one thing, the restaurants wanted another, and the moms needed a third. Making one of them happy always disappointed the others. She didn’t know how to start. Even simple problems like which colour to use for the label were impossible to answer.

Before we can serve

everyone

, we have to serve

someone

. Forgetting about all the possibilities and focusing on who would

most likely

buy, she decided it was moms with young kids who are currently shopping at health food stores. She also knew where to find them: in the health food stores! But the stores were an important partner and she didn’t know what they would want.

She found a way to kill two birds with one stone by going into only the small, independent health food stores and asking them to place a few bottles of her condiment beside the breakfast foods. It’s a great commitment to ask for (some shelf space) that would help distinguish between kind words and serious retailers. She would return in a week to ask them about their experiences. If the stores were happy and the product sold, she could begin finding ways to talk to their customers (and her end consumers), perhaps via an in-store tasting.

This journey sounds obvious when we look at it as a case study. But when we’re in the moment, choosing a really specific customer segment just feels like we’re losing all the other options. And that loss is painful. Remind yourself that you’ll get to the whole world eventually. But you’ve got to start somewhere specific.

Big brands or mom & pop?

I was once thrilled that my customer segment was “advertisers”. Everyone advertises somehow, so naturally this was very exciting. Our market was practically infinite! I talked to mom-and-pop shops, e-tailers, big brands, creative agencies, SMEs, music labels and more. Everyone I talked to had different needs, constraints, problems, and desires.

Everything we tried ended up

sort of

working. Everything was

somewhat

promising. Some people were talking about paying us $10,000/month while others scoffed at the idea of paying $10. Every new feature was moderately popular. But if we tried to cut any of those middling features, we would get an uproar. It was always someone’s favourite part.

In reality, our customer segment was just too broad. We were trying to serve everyone simultaneously. We said “yes” to every request. Every debate over a new feature could be won by claiming, “Well,

those

guys would love it.” The reverse argument could be made to prevent any feature’s removal.

The big trouble was that we could prove ourselves neither right nor wrong. We could never say that a new idea had really worked or totally failed. We were paying attention to so many customer segments that there was pretty much always someone it worked for. But making a so-so product for a bunch of audiences isn’t quite the same as making an incredible product for one.

Getting specific about your ideal customers allows you to filter out all the noise which comes from everyone else. In our case, we eventually noticed unusually strong signals from creative agencies who wanted to be edgy. We ignored everyone who wasn’t them, cut a bunch of features and were finally able to get a sense of what was working and what wasn’t.

But what does it mean!?

I recently spoke to a couple founders who have been working hard on their customer conversations. They were using every sales meeting as an opportunity to learn. They were asking good questions which pass The Mom Test and were pushing for advancement and commitment whenever it was relevant. And yet, they were still super confused and weren’t sure how to move the business to the next level. They couldn’t decide which features to build and which to cut. They didn’t know how to improve their marketing language. To make matters worse, the feedback they were getting was wildly inconsistent. If they ran twenty conversations, they ended up with twenty different must-have features and twenty separate must-solve problems. The more people they talked to, the more confused they got. What was going on here?

Their customer segment was incredibly broad, but in a sneaky way. Imagine that we’re building something for “students”. I’ve got a picture of an American undergraduate in my head, and maybe you picture a British grad student, but we manage to agree on features and start building.

Once we launch, the feedback starts coming in. But it’s not what we expect. One user needs to add formal citations. Another wants practice questions. A third needs it to run on the iPad. A fourth needs eighty collaborators who can share the same computer. The next needs to use the app through an intermittent internet connection. We’re looking at this list of requirements and our soul feels like it’s being forced through a colander. This will literally take us years to build. Where do we start?

It turns out that “students” is a broader segment than we initially expected. The first is a PhD student. The second is an ambitious youngling at a prep school. The third is a homeschooling parent who wants to use it with her kid. The fourth is a rural village in the Indian rice belt where the local kids are self-educating through the one shared computer. The fifth is in Africa, running the app off a shaky cellphone connection. All are “students”.

The confused founders we met at the beginning of this section were having the same experience, but for “sales organisations” instead of “students”. There are countless kinds of sales organisations with fundamentally different needs, workflows, tools and goals. But from the outside, they all look like companies who do sales. Even if you narrow it down with a demographic constraint, as these guys did (sales organisations with 25-250 salespeople), you’re still facing impossible amounts of variation.

These guys weren’t having 20 conversations with their customers. They were having one conversation each with 20 different types of customers. That’s why the feedback was so inconsistent.

In these cases, an industry expert can be hugely helpful in providing a taxonomy of the industry. It will give you a better starting point for choosing where to begin. If you don’t have access to this high-level view, you still want to take your best guess and get specific. The next section on Customer Slicing is one way to approach it. Over time, your understanding of the industry will improve and you can adjust your mental categories as needed. When your customer feedback is all over the map, you can’t extract value. Once you get specific, you can learn.

Rule of thumb:

If you aren’t finding consistent problems and goals, you don’t have a specific enough customer segment.

Customer slicing

If you’re facing a generic or varied set of customer segments, you can use Customer Slicing to pick a concrete starting point. Start with any segment and then keep slicing off better and better sub-sets of it until you’ve got a tangible sense of who you can go talk to and where you can find them. Start with a broad segment and ask:

Within this group, which type of person would want it most?

Would everyone within this group buy/use it, or only some?

Why does that sub-set want it? (e.g. what is their specific problem)

Does everyone in the group have that motivation or only some?

What additional motivations are there?

Which other types of people have these motivations?

You’ll have two sets of answers: the first is a collection of demographic groups and the second is a set of goals/motivations. Some will still be fairly generic. Go back through the generic ones and keep slicing. Just repeat the questions above. Within that sub-group, who wants it most? Repeat, repeat.

As a quick example, say I’m building some sort of high-end fitness gadget for busy professionals. It’s going to be expensive, so I figure they have to be high-income (finance professionals?), and it’s going to be digital, so I imagine they’ll be young (25-35?). And finance professionals live in big cities, so we’ll tack that on.

So my customer segment is “finance professionals, age 25-35, living in a major city”, right? No! This is a totally worthless segment because it doesn’t help me make better decisions and doesn’t help me find them.

On the other hand, if I slice it down further to the sub-group who wants it most, then I can get somewhere. We could slice that initial segment into something like: finance professionals in London currently training for a marathon. Better! We know this slice is taking fitness seriously, so we might suspect they’re stronger early adopters. We could slice that even further by saying that we want the sub-sub-subset who go to the gym during their lunch hour. Now we can have all the customer conversations we desire for the price of a membership to a gym in London’s financial district.

If there isn’t a clear physical or digital location at which you can find your customer segment, then it’s probably still too broad. Go back up the list and slice it into finer pieces until you know where to find them. A customer segment isn’t very useful if there’s no way you can get in touch.

Now that we have a bunch of who-where pairs, we can decide who to start with based on who seems most:

Profitable or big

Easy to reach

Personally rewarding

Don’t plan and theorise forever about this stuff. Just spend a few minutes to reach to a concrete initial segment so you can go find a few of them and move the business forward.

As we mentioned, you’ll broaden your segment back out later. But your learning will go faster (and be more useful) for now by choosing someone who is specific and who also and meets the three big criteria of being reachable, profitable, and personally rewarding.

On a personal note, I really feel that third factor is important; it’s worth choosing customers you admire and enjoy being around. This stuff is hard work and can be a real grind if you’re cynical about the people or the industry you’re trying to understand and serve.

Rule of thumb:

Good customer segments are a who-where pair. If you don’t know where to go to find your customers, keep slicing your segment into smaller pieces until you do.

Talking to the wrong people

You can’t get the data you need if you’re talking to the wrong people. There are 3 ways to end up fall into this clearly unhelpful trap.

You have too-broad of a segment and are talking to everyone

You have multiple customer segments and missed some of them

You are selling to businesses with a complicated buying process and have overlooked some of the stakeholders

We’ve already talked about #1. If you talk to everyone, many of them are inevitably going to be wrong.

Regarding #2 and 3, you can miss segments and overlook buyers in lots of ways. The first important step is to know they exist. Sometimes it’s obvious. If you are a multi-sided marketplace, you clearly have multiple customer segments.

Other times it’s sneakier. If you’re building an app for kids, you need to understand and sell to both them and their parents. If you’re building something for public schools, you need to understand the teachers, the students, the administration, and potentially even the parent-teacher association and the tax payers.

You’ll also need to worry about multiple groups if you rely on an important partner, whether for manufacturing, distribution, or promotion. If your business relies on them, you’d better understand their goals and constraints just as well as you understand those of your customers.

Don’t fall into the trap of only talking to the most senior or important people you can find. You want to talk to people who are representative of your customers, not the ones who sound impressive on your status report. When I was building interactive advertising products, I spent lots of time talking to executives and none talking to the kids who were supposed to love our products.

A common question is whether you need to run customer conversations separately for all the various segments in a multi-sided marketplace. Yes, you do. But hopefully that isn’t quite so scary now that you know how to Keep it Casual and reduce the time cost of your learning.
