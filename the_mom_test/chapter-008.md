Running the process

## Chapter 8

Running the process

Even if you do everything else right, you can get bad results without the right process wrapped around your conversations. Showing up and hoping for the best isn’t making a good use of anyone’s time. You need to do a little bit of work before and after to extract full value.

A common anti-pattern is for the business guy to go to all the meetings and subsequently tell the rest of the team what they should do. Bad idea. Telling the rest of the team “What I learned” is functionally equivalent to telling them “What you’ll do.” Therefore, owning the customer conversations creates a de-facto dictator with “The customer said so” as the ultimate trump card.

And that’s a problem because, as we’ve seen, it’s easy to misinterpret what the customer said.

When all the customer learning is stuck in someone’s head instead of being disseminated to the rest of the team, you’ve got a learning bottleneck. Avoid creating (or being) the bottleneck. To do that, the learning must be shared with the entire founding team promptly and faithfully, which depends on good notes plus a bit of pre- and post-meeting work.

The most extreme way to bottleneck is to go to the meetings alone and take crappy notes which you don’t review with your team. At that point, your head has become the ultimate repository of customer truth and everyone just has to do what you say.

In my case, I once bottlenecked so hard that our CTO quit while saying, “We’re never going to succeed if you keep changing what we’re doing.” In my defence, the stuff I’d learned was true (at least, I think it was). But it didn’t matter anyway since I hadn’t properly communicated it to the rest of the team.

Learning bottlenecks can be created from either end: the founder in touch with customers can do a bad job of sharing it, or the product team can refuse to engage with customers and what they say.

Symptoms of a learning bottleneck:

“You just worry about the product. I’ll handle the customers.”

“Because the customers told me so!”

“I don’t have time to talk to people — I need to be coding!”

Avoiding bottlenecks has three parts: prepping, reviewing, and taking good notes.

Prepping

Your most important preparation work is to ensure you know your current list of 3 big questions. Figure them out with your team and make a point to face the scary questions.

If you’ve already learned the facts of your customer and industry, then you should also know what commitment and next steps you are going to push for at the end of the meeting.

It’s easier to guide the conversation and stay on track if you have an existing set of beliefs that you’re updating. Spend up to an hour writing down your best guesses about what the person you’re about to talk to cares about and wants. You’ll probably be wrong, but it’s easier to keep the discussion on track and hit important points if you’ve created a skeleton. If you have an appropriately focused segment, then you’ll only rarely need to do this.

While prepping, if you come across a question which could be answered with desk research, take a moment to do it. You want to move past the obvious stuff and use your in-person conversations to find insights the internet can’t give you.

Similarly, if you’re about to meet with a business, do your basic due diligence on LinkedIn and the company website. It takes 5 minutes and will save you from trashing the conversation and looking like an idiot.

Sit down with your whole founding team when you prep. You want both business and product to be represented. If you leave part of the company out of the prep, then you end up missing their concerns in the customer conversations.

Some founders react with hostility to the whole idea. They’ll say something along the lines of, “We just need to be building the darn product, not wasting our time talking to people!” This is a reasonable reaction if they feel like the customer conversations are a waste of time. And that could actually be the case if you’ve been doing them wrong.

The minimum prep is to ask a grumpy cofounder to “humour me” and then spend ten minutes picking the right learning goals for the upcoming conversations. Once you start having conversations that save time instead of costing it, everyone will come around.

These aren’t long, involved strategy discussions. Your gut reaction is enough. You don’t need to be so rigorous. A little prep goes a long way, but you do need a little. All you’re really trying to figure out is:

What do we want to learn from these guys?

Rule of thumb:

If you don’t know what you’re trying to learn, you shouldn’t bother having the conversation.

Reviewing

After a conversation, just review your notes with your team and update your beliefs and big three questions as appropriate.

The goal is to ensure the learning is now on paper and in everyone’s head instead of just in yours. Talk through the key quotes and main takeaways of the conversation, as well as any problems you ran into.

I also like to talk about the meta-level of the conversation itself: which questions worked and which didn’t? How can we do better next time? Were there any important signals or questions we missed? This stuff is more craft than science: you have to actively practice it to get better. It’s a valuable skill for your team to have, so it’s worth spending a bit of time improving.

Just like prepping, reviewing is so simple that it sounds like a non-step. It’s tempting to skip it. Don’t! The review is important. Disseminate learnings to your team as quickly and as directly as possible, using notes and exact quotes wherever you can. It keeps you in sync, leads to better decisions, prevents arguments, and allows your whole team to benefit from the learning you’ve worked so hard to acquire.

On a logistical level, some teams have a quick chat about the results of each meeting as soon as they get back to the office. Others have longer weekly meetings to go through all the week’s notes and learnings. To deal with working remotely at FounderCentric, we keep a chat window open exclusively for sharing our customer learnings whenever we finish a meeting.

Who should show up

Everyone on the team who is making big decisions (including tech decisions) needs to be involved in at least the occasional customer conversation. The tech guys don’t need to be at most of them, but you’ll all learn a ton from hearing customer reactions first-hand. You’ll also be able to help each other catch and fix your conversation mistakes and biases.

Meetings go best when you’ve got two people at them. One person can focus on taking notes and the other can focus on talking. As the second person, you may notice the lead asking bad questions or missing a signal they should be digging into. Just jump in and fix them.

Don’t send more than two people unless it’s group-on-group or you’ve got a particularly good reason to do so. Three folks interviewing someone can be a little overwhelming.

Going in solo is fine once you get good at taking concise notes. The main problem of running solo is that it’s harder to catch yourself when you start going off-track by pitching, asking bad questions, or missing the point.

If you’re shy and have no cofounder to take the lead, call in a favour with a friend to come to your first couple conversations with you. Play the more passive role of the note-taker until you’re comfortable. If there’s no workaround and you have to bite the bullet, remember that confidence is domain-specific and that it will stop being so awkward as you do it more. Focus on understanding the process and getting better.

You can't outsource or hire someone to do customer learning. There are exceptional team dynamics where it works, but generally speaking, the founders need to be in the meetings themselves. When a hired gun brings you bad news (“The problem isn’t real and nobody cares”), properly assimilating it is difficult.

More insidiously, if the signal is lukewarm, it’s tempting for a hire to gloss over it. Hiring out your learning is a guaranteed way to get bad signals. Until you’ve got a working business model and a repeatable sales or marketing process, the founders need to be in the meetings themselves.

On the bright side, even though you have to be in the room to process the learning, you don’t necessarily have to be the one setting up or leading the meetings. You can hire people to help as long as you’re there with them, listening.

How to write it down

Taking good notes is the best way to keep your team (and investors and advisors) in the loop. Plus, notes make it harder to lie to yourself. And when, months later, you decide to adjust the business’s direction, you’ll be able to return to your notes instead of having to go do a whole new set of interviews.

When possible, write down exact quotes. Wrap them in quotation marks so you know it’s verbatim. You can later use them in your marketing language, fundraising decks, and to resolve arguments with skeptical teammates. Other times the details aren’t so relevant and you can just jot down the gist.

In either case, add symbols to your notes as context and shorthand. I use about a dozen main symbols and make up more in the field as needed. You probably won't exactly copy mine, so don't worry about memorising them. You’ll build your own go-to list as you have more conversations.

:) :( :| ☇ ⨅ ☐ ⤴ ^ ☑＄♀☆

Emotions

:) Excited

:( Angry

:| Embarrassed

Someone saying “that’s a problem” can be interpreted totally differently depending on whether they are neutral or outraged. Any strong emotion is worth writing down. For example, depending on your industry, you might also choose to make symbols for lust, envy or laughter. Capture the big emotions and remember to dig into them when they come up.

Their life

☇ Pain or problem (symbol is a lightning bolt)

⨅ Goal or job-to-be-done (symbol is a soccer/football goal)

☐ Obstacle

⤴ Workaround

^ Background or context (symbol is a distant mountain)

These five “life” symbols are your bread and butter. Combine them with emotion symbols where appropriate. Pains and obstacles carry a lot more weight when someone is embarrassed or angry about them.

Obstacles are preventing a customer from solving their problems even though they want to. They’re important because you’ll probably also have to deal with them. For example, a lot of corporate folks would

love

to use cloud services and

hate

their current tools, but can’t, because their company’s IT policy is an obstacle. Their workaround might be to use their personal phone as a secondary computer or by doing certain work at home. Also worth noting.

Specifics

☑ Feature request or purchasing criteria

＄ Money or budgets or purchasing process

♀ Mentioned a specific person or company

☆ Follow-up task

As we discussed, feature requests usually get ignored, but they're a good signal to capture and explore. Must-have purchasing criteria are obviously more important. Money signals are also key.

Write down specific names and companies. If it’s someone they know, ask for an intro at the end of the conversation. If it’s a competitor or alternate solution, write it down to research it later.

Put a big star on items to follow-up on after the meeting, especially next-steps you promised as a condition of their advancement/commitment.

Where to write it down

You want to take your customer notes so that they are:

Able to be sorted, mixed, and re-arranged

Able to be combined with the notes of the rest of your team

Permanent and retrievable

Not mixed in with other random noise like todo lists and ideas

In practice, I’ve found that taking notes in my primary notebook is practically useless. Over the course of several months’ sprawl, you set an insurmountable search and retrieval task for yourself. If you won’t look at your notes, they aren’t much good.

If you do end up taking notes in non-ideal places, you just need to spend a little extra post-meeting time moving them over into your permanent format. Otherwise you’ll be kicking yourself when you don’t entirely remember that amazing quote you’d love to put on your website.

What is a better note-taking medium?

Google Docs spreadsheets and Evernote are both great for team sharing, search, and retrieval. Spreadsheets are wonderfully sortable if you write your key signals in their own column. The downside is that it comes across as rude to take notes directly on a computer during a meeting, so you add a bit of mandatory post-meeting work to transfer your notes. I always found this a bit annoying, but it’s way better than losing your learning in an off-topic notebook.

A dedicated notebook is fine, if you can remember to carry it with you and use it. For a while, I would use my regular notebook for my customer notes and then just tear out every page which wasn’t from an interview so it was easier to find them later. Hardly the most elegant.

My favourite medium is index cards. Post-it notes also work. I carry around blank cards and take notes on them, with one quote or learning per card (along with a signal icon, of course). After the meeting I jot down the date and who I was talking to. If your whole team uses cards for their conversations, you can lay them all out on the table for easy access and sorting. For example, if you learn that the you’re solving a non-problem, you can just pull out all the cards marked with a lightning bolt and find yourself a new problem that customers have already validated for you.

When I first started, I would make audio recordings, but that suffered from the same problem as notebooks: I’d end up with a ton of content and no real way to sort it or find the bit I wanted. If you

do

want to use audio, you’ll find people are surprisingly willing to be recorded. Put your phone on the table as you sit down and say, “Hey, is it cool if I record this, because I’m always paranoid I’ll miss something important in my notes. It won’t get shared with anyone or posted anywhere.” Almost everyone says yes, but it does blow your cover if you’re trying to Keep it Casual.

If you embrace Keeping it Casual, you’ll find customer conversations appearing out of nowhere and catching you by surprise. Just go with it. I’ve got notes written on paper plates from a pizza party, on beer mats from the pub, and on newspapers from the cafe. Just transfer them over to your main storage system once you get back to the office. It’s better to capture what’s said on something weird than to try to remember all the important bits.

If it’s totally inappropriate to take notes during the chat, just have the conversation and then immediately retreat to a corner to write down what was said. This is how I usually handle customer conversations at the pub or conferences.

Regardless of the medium, the most important thing is that the notes are lightweight enough that you’ll actually review them yourself and with your team.

Rule of thumb:

Notes are useless if you don’t look at them.

The process

Talking to customers is a tool, not an obligation. If it’s not going to help or you don’t want to do it for whatever reason, just skip it. I’m sure you’ve been on the receiving end of a half-assed survey sent out by some new startup to tick the box marked “learn from customers” on their startup todo list. There are better ways to waste your time.

Without figuring out what actually matters to your company and how to deal with it effectively, you’re just going through the motions.

Warning signs that you’re just going through the motions:

You’re talking more than they are

They are complimenting you or your idea

You told them about your idea and don’t have next steps

You don’t have notes

You haven’t looked through your notes with your team

You got an unexpected answer and it didn’t change your idea

You weren’t scared of any of the questions you asked

You aren’t sure what you’re trying to learn in this conversation

The persistent presence of any of these problems suggests that you’re doing something wrong and wasting your time.

Here are the steps I go through to keep on track. Feel free to ignore or tweak as needed given your situation and company. It’s as light-weight as I’ve been able to get it and should reduce rather than increase the amount of time you need to spend on conversations.

The process before a batch of conversations:

If you haven’t yet, choose a focused, findable segment

With your team, decide your big 3 learning goals

If relevant, decide on ideal next steps and commitments

If conversations are the right tool, figure out who to talk to

Create a series of best guesses about what the person cares about

If a question could be answered via desk research, do that first

During the conversation:

Frame the conversation

Keep it casual

Ask good questions which pass The Mom Test

Deflect compliments, anchor fluff, and dig beneath signals

Take good notes

If relevant, press for commitment and next steps

After a batch of conversations:

With your team, review your notes and key customer quotes

If relevant, transfer notes into permanent storage

Update your beliefs and plans

Decide on the next 3 big questions

The goal of this process is twofold. First, to ensure you’re spending your time well by attacking the questions which really matter and making use of the brains of the whole founding team. Second, to spread any new learning through your team as quickly and completely as possible.

There you go. Now you know everything I do about how to learn from conversations. Combine this process with The Mom Test, Keeping it Casual, and Advancement for maximum learning in minimum time. But even if it goes wrong, don’t worry so much. Eternity will forgive.

This stuff is fast

The time scales of the process are important. The point is to make your business move faster, not slower.

Don’t spend a week prepping for meetings; spend an hour and then go talk to people. Anything more is stalling.

Don’t spend months doing full-time customer conversations before beginning to move on a product. Spend a week, maybe two. Get your bearings and then give them something to commit to.

You’ll keep talking to customers for the life of your company, of course. I’m not advising you to become a recluse after the first two weeks. Your customers are a crucial source of ongoing insight. With the tools in this book (especially Keeping it Casual) you should be able to keep benefitting from customer learning without feeling like you’re wasting so much time on it. You can do it alongside growing your business rather than in place of it.

Customer learning can move really quickly when you’re doing it right. This book isn’t meant to give you an excuse to squander precious months theorising and planning the “perfect question”. It’s meant to help you extract maximum value in minimum time so you can get back to what really matters: building your business.

Rule of thumb:

Go build your dang company already.
