Asking important questions

## Chapter 3

Asking important questions

Once we know about The Mom Test and start trying to ask non-biasing questions, sometimes we over-compensate and ask completely trivial ones. Asking someone how old they are isn’t biasing, but it also doesn’t move your business forward. You have to apply The Mom Test to the questions which matter. Otherwise you’re just spinning your wheels.

In addition to ensuring that you aren’t asking trivialities, you also need to search out the world-rocking scary questions you’ve been unintentionally shrinking from. The best way to find them is with thought experiments. Imagine that the company has failed and ask why that happened. Then imagine it as a huge success and ask what had to be true to get there. Find ways to learn about those critical pieces.

You can tell it’s an important question when its answer could completely change (or disprove) your business. If you get an unexpected answer to a question and it doesn’t affect what you’re doing, it wasn’t a terribly important question to begin with.

Every time you talk to someone, you should be asking at least one question which has the potential to destroy your currently imagined business.

One of my companies had some legal ambiguities around content ownership. We were okay in theory, but lacked strong precedents. I was always a bit nervous we would get “found out.” A key customer’s execs were excited and their creatives were thrilled. We had even brought the stubborn tech team around to our side. But in all my early customer conversations, I never asked to talk to their lawyers. For whatever reason, that was an important question which I shrunk from, and not asking it cost us at least half a million bucks.

There’s no easy solution to making yourself face and ask these questions. I once heard the general life advice that, for unpleasant tasks, you should imagine what you would have someone else do if you were delegating it. Then do that. And remember, you’re allowed to ask about money. You're a startup. It's okay.

Rule of thumb:

You should be terrified of at least one of the questions you’re asking in every conversation.

Love bad news

One of the reasons we avoid important question is because asking them is scary. It can bring us to the unsettling realisation that our beloved idea is fundamentally flawed. Or that the major client is never going to buy. Although this sort of news seems unfortunate, we need to learn to love it. It’s solid learning and is getting us closer to the truth.

If you’ve only got one shot, then bad news is bad news. If your bungee jumping cord doesn’t work, that’s bad. If you’ve sunk your retirement savings into opening a cafe and it doesn’t work, that’s bad. If you hustle together $50k to start your business and spend all $50k on your first idea only to see it fail, that’s bad.

On the other hand, if you have $50k and spend $5k to learn you’re running down a dead end, that’s awesome. You can use the rest to find a viable path to your goal, with the advantage of all the extra things you now know.

Similarly, if you have an exciting idea for a new product and go talk to a couple customers who don’t actually care about it, then that’s a great result. You just saved yourself however much time and money it would have cost to try building and selling it.

We go through the futile process of asking for opinions and fishing for compliments because we crave approval. We want to believe that the support and sign-off of someone we respect means our venture will succeed. But really, that person’s opinion doesn’t matter. They have no idea if the business is going to work. Only the market knows.

Learning that your beliefs are wrong is frustrating, but it’s progress. It’s bringing you ever closer to the truth of a real problem and a good market. The worst thing you can do is ignore the bad news while searching for some tiny grain of validation to celebrate. You want the truth, not a gold star.

Some of the most informative (and thus best) responses you can get are along the lines of, “Umm, I’m not so sure about that” and “That's pretty neat.” Both are lukewarm responses which tell you they don’t care.

In this context, “best” means learning, not selling. If you’re a sales guy going door to door selling gadgets and someone doesn’t care, then that is a bad result: you’re not getting paid. But if you’re trying to decide whether to invest your time and money in developing, building and promoting that gadget, then lukewarm is a terrific response. It gives you a crystal clear signal that this person does not care. It’s reliable information you can take to the bank.

The classic error in response to a lukewarm signal is to “up your game” and pitch them until they say something nice. Unless they’re holding a check, the only thing to gain from “convincing” them are false positives. You’re not here to collect compliments; you’re trying to learn the truth. Their lukewarm response already gave you that.

If they’re still engaged in the conversation, it’s worth asking a couple follow-up questions to understand the nature of their apathy. Is the “problem” not actually that big of a deal? Are they fundamentally different from your ideal customers? Do they not care about the specific implementation? Are they worn out and skeptical from hearing too many pitches, like cafe owners in the aftermath of Groupon? Are they just plain tired today?

After that, say a big thanks and leave them to their day. They’ve probably helped you more than the guy who said he loved it.

Rule of thumb:

There’s more reliable information in a “meh” than a “Wow!” You can’t build a business on a lukewarm response.

Look before you zoom

Another way to miss the important questions is by obsessing over ultimately unimportant nuances. We let ourselves get stuck in the details before understanding the big picture.

Everyone has problems they know about, but don’t actually care enough about to fix. And if you zoom in too quickly and lead them to that semi-problem, they’ll happily drown you in all the unimportant details. Zooming in too quickly on a super-specific problem before you understand the rest of the customers life can irreparably confuse your learnings.

A (really, really) bad conversation:

**You:** “Hi. Thanks for taking the time. We’re building phone and tablet apps to help people stay in shape and just wanted to understand how you stay fit.”

*This isn’t a terrible opening, but I’d generally avoid mentioning the idea unless I have to, since it does bias them.*

**Them:** “Okay.”

*I never exercise, so this should be quick.*

**You:** “How often do you go to the gym?”

*This sort of demographic data doesn’t give you any new insight, but can be useful for figuring out what sort of person you’re talking to so you can ask relevant follow-ups.*

**Them:** “Not really ever.”

*Well, looks like we’re done here then!*

**You:** “What would you say is your biggest problem with going to the gym?”

*This is where the conversation goes horribly wrong. Instead of figuring out whether staying fit is actually a real problem, we’re prematurely zooming in on it. Any response we get is going to be dangerously misleading.*

**Them:** “I guess the time it takes to get there. I’m always kind of busy, you know?”

*Wait, who says I have a problem with going to the gym? I thought I just told you I don’t care about the gym! But if I had to choose one, I guess I’d go with convenience. Not that I’ve done a pushup in 5 years. Pushups are pretty convenient.*

**You:** “Perfect. That’s great. And could you rank these 4 in terms of which is most important to you in a fitness program: convenience, personalisation, novelty, or cost?”

*Note that we’re still assuming we’re talking to a person who actually cares about getting in shape. Questions like this don’t actually tell you if the person cares about any of it at all.*

**Them:** “Probably convenience, then cost, then personalisation, then novelty.”

*Since you asked, I’ll answer. Hypothetically speaking, of course.*

**You:** “Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much. We’re working on an app to help you exercise in the convenience of your own home. I think it’s going to be a great fit for what you care about.”

*Totally missing the point and mis-interpreting the conversation as validation. Now fishing for compliments.*

**Them:** “Cool. I’d love to try it when it launches.”

*Half-hearted compliment plus non-committal stalling tactic.*

**You:** “Great — I’ll send over one of our beta keys so you can check it out.”

*We got a user!*

**Them:** “Thanks.”

*I am literally never going to type that in.*

The reason this conversation is so very bad is because, if you aren’t paying attention, it seems like it went well. When you zoom in too quickly on one problem area, you can think you’ve validated a “top” problem when you haven’t. You just led them there.

If you ask me what’s my biggest problem with staying fit, I’ll probably tell you it’s the time cost of going to the gym. Because I know I’m supposed to say something. But then, if you build me a workout-at-home app, I’m going to ignore it. Even though commute time is the

biggest

problem with getting in shape, the whole area of fitness just isn’t something I care about enough to act on. My #1 fitness problem is still an unimportant one.

Let’s start the conversation again and fix it when it starts to go off track. You can

A good conversation:

**You:** “How often do you go to the gym?”

**Them:** “Um. Not really ever.”

*Looks like we’re done here.*

**You:** “Why not?”

*Instead of taking for granted that staying fit is one of their top priorities, let’s dig into the motivations.*

**Them:** “I don’t know, it’s just not something I’m that worried about, you know?”

*Not trying to fix this, so unlikely to buy or use an app.*

**You:** “When’s the last time you did try? Have you ever joined a gym or taken up jogging or anything?”

*Let’s anchor the generic just to make sure…*

**Them:** “Oh yeah, I used to be into sports in high school. It just hasn’t been a big deal since I settled down. Running around after the kids gives me all the cardio I need!”

**You:** “Haha, gotcha. Thanks for the time!”

*This was a pleasant conversation and we learned what we came for, so we can abandon ship and leave him to his day.*

The premature zoom is a real problem because it leads to data which seems like validation, but is actually worthless. In other words, it’s a big source of false positives.

Let’s re-run the same conversation, but instead of immediately zooming in on exercise, we’ll start more generic, since we aren’t sure that fitness is a must-solve problem:

A good conversation:

**You:** “What are your big goals and focuses right now?”

*Products which solve problems on this list are infinitely more likely to get bought. We might alternately ask for major annoyances, costs, or joys.*

**Them:** “The big one is finalising that promotion at work. And we just bought our first house, so I’ve got to get that all fixed up and ready to go. Exciting times. And I want to find a bit more time for the missus, you know? Things have been pretty busy lately.”

*Work, house, and marriage. Not looking good for us!*

**You:** “You’re buying a new house and expect to be

*less*

busy?”

**Them:** “Can’t blame a guy for hoping.”

**You:** “Is getting healthier on that list?”

*We probably already know the answer, but it doesn’t hurt to ask leading questions when you’re about to abort the conversation anyway. If they come back with a positive, just be a little extra careful in making sure they aren’t lying.*

**Them:** “I’m actually feeling pretty good at the moment.”

*Not a customer.*

We don’t always need to start the conversation from square one of “do they care at all?” Sometimes we already know the problem exists as a top priority and we can safely zoom in immediately.

For example, let’s say we help drive qualified leads to small business websites. We know that marketing is always a top 3 problem for small businesses, so we can focus on it and start the conversation by zooming in with a question like:

**You:** What are your big problems with marketing?

*We can safely zoom in on the problem of marketing since we’re pretty much 100% certain it’s a must-solve problem that people are ready to pay for.*

**Versus:** 

**You:** What are your big problems right now?

*If we aren’t sure it’s a must-solve problem, we can start more generic to see if they care enough about the problem category to mention it unprompted.*

Now imagine you’ve built the aforementioned marketing tool for small businesses and realise it could also be used to help bloggers get more attention. You’re wondering if you have another strong customer segment. However, since blogs have a harder time monetising traffic than small businesses, we can’t necessarily assume that they’re also going to happily pay for traffic.

For example, I have a blog which I quite like (but which I don’t take seriously as a business). If you’re talking to me and you ask, “Hey Rob, what are your top problems with

marketing

your blog?”

Then you’ve just prematurely zoomed in on a non-problem.

I’m going to tell you some sort of answer which sounds legit but is actually misleading. I might say that my keywords are all kind of generic, so it’s hard to attract the right people. Or that I walk a fine line between writing beginner and advanced articles, so choosing the right topics is always weird. Whatever. Problems exist with my blog marketing, but the whole space just isn’t something I’m too fussed about. I blog because it’s fun, not because it pays my rent.

To have a useful conversation, you need to zoom back out to ask about my blog in general, rather than marketing my blog.

A good conversation:

**You:** “Hey Rob, what are the top problems with your blog?”

**Me:** “I’m grumpy that Google Reader disappeared — I lost like half my followers. And this book is consuming all of my interest in writing, so I haven’t really posted in months. And Wordpress seems so slow these days.”

*Of the topics here, one of them (Google Reader and audience size) is related to marketing, so you can anchor on that and figure out whether I’m a customer or just a complainer.*

**You:** “That Google Reader thing is a mess. What are you doing about it?”

*Now that you’ve let me raise the topic, you know it’s on my mind and can more safely zoom in to talk about that specifically. As before, try to figure out what I’m already spending time and money on.*

**Me:** “Nothing, really. I don’t know what to do. But it sucks.”

*I’m not appearing terribly motivated, but the fact that I don’t know what to do could give you hope.*

**You:** “Have you looked into what your options are?”

*Continue anchoring and digging.*

**Me:** “No, I just caught the drama on Hacker News.”

*I knew the reader-pocalypse was coming and didn’t even search around to properly understand the implications and my options. This just isn’t a big deal for me, despite how “annoyed”  I claim to be.*

**You:** “Are you spending a lot of time working to build your audience back up?”

*You are digging into the audience size signal, since it’s relevant to your space. This is a fluff-inviting question (hypothetical future-tense), so you should be skeptical of the answer, but it’s hard to see a better way to get at the information you want from here. Not every question can be perfect, sadly.*

**Me:** “Probably just keep on writing when I have something to say. It’s more of a hobby than a business, really.”

*At this point, you might be suspicious about how much I actually care about my blog. When it’s not clear whether a problem is a must-solve-right-now (e.g. you’re selling a painkiller) or a nice-to-have (you’re selling a vitamin), you can get some clarity by asking cost/value questions like the following.*

“Does-this-problem-matter” questions:

“How seriously do you take your blog?”

“Do you make money from it?”

“Have you tried making more money from it?”

“How much time do you spend on it each week?”

“Do you have any major aspirations for your blog?”

“Which tools and services do you use for it?”

“What are you already doing to improve this?”

“What are the 3 big things you’re trying to fix or improve right now?”

Some of these questions are generic, but give us signals that we can anchor on and dig around. The bulk of them are about finding out whether the person we’re talking to is taking this space seriously. Are they spending money? Making money? Is the problem in their top 3? Are they actively looking for solutions?

When you fall into a premature zoom, you can waste a ton of time figuring out the minutia of a trivial problem. Even if you learn everything there is to know about that particular problem, you still haven’t got a business.

Rule of thumb:

Start broad and don't zoom in until you’ve found a strong signal, both with your whole business and with every conversation.

Gaze upon the elephant

Sometimes we comfort ourselves by asking questions which don’t actually de-risk the business or resolve those critical, big, scary, lurking questions. We ignore the elephant in the room.

Let’s say we suspect that teachers from the poorest schools are completely overloaded, and that our tools would save them time so they could better educate their students. We go talk to them and confirm that yes, they are completely overloaded. We then spend weeks with them, figuring out exactly what their dream tool would do. Unfortunately, we've missed the elephant, which is that the poorest schools may not have the budgets available to pay us what we need to sustain and grow a business. We're liable to spend a huge amount of time exploring a real and urgent problem, only to hop into the deadpool due to our customer’s budgeting issues.

Startups tend to have multiple failure points (e.g. the problems of the teachers and the ability of the schools to pay us). If any of these conditions doesn't exist, we must overhaul our idea. It’s tempting to obsess over the most interesting of several failure points and ignore the others. And then we miss important questions.

Beyond the risks of our customers and market, we also have challenges with our own product. Overlooking product risks is just as deadly as overlooking the goals and constraints of our customers. Take the following conversation with a professional public speaker. Is it full of good data or bad data?

An ambiguous conversation:

**Them:** “…I get paid 2 or 3 grand per talk. Sometimes more if it’s corporate work.”

*Some good pricing and value signals.*

**You:** “Where do you get your gigs? Do you have an agent?”

*Trying to understand the alternatives.*

**Them:** “Yeah. He kind of sucks though. Most of my work comes through people who just know me from my blog or have seen my other talks.”

*Hardly a must-solve problem since he has a reliable workaround, but at least it’s high value.*

**You:** “What’s wrong with the agent? And why do you still work with him?”

*Dig.*

**Them:** “I’m one of the lowest-paid people they work with, so I get ignored a lot. But sometimes he brings in deals, so whatever. It’s free money.”

*Good information on his motivations and goals.*

At this point, let’s say I’m confident that getting gigs is important to him. I also know what it’s worth and how he’s currently accomplishing it. So I zoom in to introduce the problem I’m solving and the way I want to approach it.

**You:** “I’m building a marketplace to cut out the agents and connect event organisers directly with speakers. It should help you get more gigs and keep the agent fees. How would that fit into your speaking life?”

**Them:** “Man, that’s awesome. If you could get me more more gigs — or better paid ones — I’d happily drop my agent and pay you 20% of the boost. I know a bunch of other people who would love to as well.”

*This is the important bit — is it good?*

So what’s the result? Beyond being excited, we got some concrete data about how valuable this could be to him. Plus, he gave a verbal commitment to be one of our early users. It sure

seems

good.

But what did he actually tell us? He said that

if

we can get him more gigs,

then

he’ll pay a cut. Well, obviously. Who doesn’t want free money? His needs are clear: he wants to make more money by speaking. If we can send him work, he’ll share some of it with us. This was never really in doubt.

The phrase “if you could get me more gigs” is basically shifting the burden from the customer to your product. Even though you’ve found a pain, your success is dependent on a bunch of other factors, such as your ability to grow a healthy supply of paying gigs which are a good fit for him. Will you be able to do that? It remains to be seen.

This situation is easier to spot in the online advertising industry. Imagine running customer conversations with an advertiser to try to understand their pains so you can convince them to advertise on your site. They’d sort of look at you blankly and say, “Listen, if you can get enough page views, we’ll pay you for them.” In fact, it’s such a well established would-pay-to-solve-problem that you don’t even need to talk to them to set it up. You just plug in an ad network and you’re done.

Same deal with affiliate commissions. If you sell a company’s products, you get a cut. That’s just how it works. You don’t need to explore or validate or understand their problems. The risk resides in your ability to get lots of traffic and sell lots of products. If you can, they’ll pay you.

In all of these examples, the risk is in your product, not in the customer. They’ll pay if your product gets big enough.

Product risk — Can I build it? Can I grow it?

Customer/market risk — Do they want it? Will they pay me? Are there lots of them?

You can’t overlook either one. I remember talking to a founder who had wasted 3 months on worthless customer conversations. He wanted to start a company building gadgets that tracked the fertility of farm animals, ultimately boosting birthrates and thus farm revenue. When he talked to farmers, he asked questions like, “Would you switch trackers if something cheaper and more effective was available?” That’s the same as asking someone whether they would like more money. The farmers responded along the lines of, “If you can build what you say you can build, I’ll equip my whole herd.” The problem is, he couldn’t build it. The risk was in the product.

I’ve also seen this strike several of the recent companies who want to use mobile/realtime deals to drive foot traffic to bars and clubs. They run customer conversations with bar owners who confirm that: yes, they would like more customers on the slow nights; and yes, they would pay you if you could send customers on demand. The founders take this as strong validation (“They have the problem and committed to pay!”) without recognising that the vast majority of the risk is in the product, not the market. Bars will pay, but only if you can amass a huge audience of consumers. Then the founders talk to consumers and ask if they would use an app which always pointed them to booming parties with cheap booze. Again, obviously yes. But that doesn’t tell us whether we can actually achieve that critical mass of users.

Video games are pure product risk. What sort of question could you ask to validate your game idea? “Do you like having fun? Would you like to have

even more

fun?” Practically 100% of the risk is in the product and almost none is in the customer. You know people buy games. If yours is good and you can find a way to make them notice it, they’ll buy it. You don’t need to rediscover people’s desire to play video games.

This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t talk to anyone if you’re building something with product risk. In the case of the farm fertility monitor, it’s good to know that the farmer isn’t opposed to switching tech, for example. For the nightclubs, it’s good to know that they’re at least theoretically willing to pay for promotion. It would be tragic to succeed at the hard work of creating the product or community only to learn nobody will pay for it.

What all this

does

mean is that if you’ve got heavy product risk (as opposed to pure market risk), then you’re not going to be able to prove as much of your business through conversations alone. The conversations give you a starting point, but you’ll have to start building product earlier and with less certainty than if you had pure market risk.

Prepare your list of 3

Pre-plan the 3 most important things you want to learn from any given type of person (e.g. customers, investors, industry experts, key hires, etc). Update the list as your questions change.

Pre-planning your big questions makes it a lot easier to ask questions which pass The Mom Test and aren’t biasing. It also makes it easier to face the questions that hurt. When we go through an unplanned conversation, we tend to focus on trivial stuff that keeps the conversation comfortable. Instead, decide on the tough questions in a calm environment with your team.

Your 3 questions will be different for each type of person you’re talking to. If you have multiple types of customers or partners, have a list for each.

Don’t stress too much about choosing the “right” important questions. They will change. Just choose whatever seems murkiest or most important

right now

. Answer those will give you firmer footing and a better sense of direction for your next 3.

You might get answers 1-3 from customer A, answer 4 from customer B, answers 5-7 from customer C. There’s overlap and repetition, but you don’t need to repeat the full set of questions with every participant. Your time is valuable; don’t feel obliged to repeat questions you already have solid data on. Pick up where you left off and keep filling in the picture.

Knowing your list allows you to take better advantage of serendipitous encounters. Instead of running into that dream customer and asking to exchange business cards so you can “grab a coffee” (exactly like everyone else), you can just pop off your most important question. And that goes a long way toward keeping it casual (the advantages of which we’ll discuss momentarily).

Rule of thumb:

You always need a list of your 3 big questions.
